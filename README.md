# FormatWorkshop
this repo is for the Format Workshop project

## Build instructions
There is a jar executable file that can be used to run the program, it is
present inside the target directory under the name " FormatWorkshop1.0-SNAPSHOT".


However. We recommend running it using the IntelliJ API as a maven
project to make sure it runs without any errors.
